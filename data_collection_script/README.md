# GitHub Repository Crawler

This project consists of a set of scripts designed to crawl GitHub for repositories that meet specific criteria and retrieve all their tags (versions). The project is divided into four main parts:

1. **get_repo_name.py**: Retrieves the names of repositories that match the specified criteria.
2. **query_tags.py**: Fetches the tag (version) information for each repository.
3. **construct_download_list.py**: Constructs a download list of the repositories based on the tags.
4. **download_repo.py**: Downloads the repositories.
